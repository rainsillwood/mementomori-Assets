,msg1,I first met Queen Amleth <br>not too long after she was born.
,msg2,The moment her small hand <br>gripped my finger...<br>I made a vow—
,msg3,to protect her until <br>I breathed my last.
,msg4,"However, a fight for <br>the crown plunged her <br>entire family into war. <br>It was too much for Queen <br>Amleth’s heart to bear."
,msg5,"Their lust for the thone <br>endangered the lives <br>of the citizens,"
,msg6,so she had no choice but <br>to take Executioner and <br>put an end to it all.
,msg7,A light of solitude emanated <br>from her eyes—sharp enough <br>to pierce through the sadness <br>that was once in its place.
,msg8,If such loneliness is the destiny <br>that must be borne by those <br>who are called rulers...
,msg9,would I even be able to <br>stand by her side?
