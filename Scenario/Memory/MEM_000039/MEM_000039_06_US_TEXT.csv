,msg1-1,"Songs are melodies <br>from the heart. <br>If I fill them with prayers, <br>I can reach through to anyone."
,msg1-2,Is that not the truth?
,msg1-3,"If it is...<br>I beg you, Mother..."
,msg1-4,Hear my voice!
,msg1-5,I poured every ounce of <br>my soul into my song...<br>hoping to restore <br>my mother’s heart.
,msg1-6,"Then, she looked at me..."
,msg1-7,"her eyes shrouded in darkness, <br>save for a sliver of light <br>that refused to die."
,msg2-1,She then called out to me... <br>“Primavera...”
,msg2-2,It was as if time had stopped...
,msg2-3,"In that moment, <br>Mother named me the <br>next <ct=3000>songstress of hope</ct>—"
,msg2-4,the successor to the name <br>“Primavera.”
,msg3-1,But in that very instant...
,msg3-2,a sword pierced right <br>through her body.
,msg4-1,"Even as she was <br>impaled by the knight, <br>Mother continued to sing <br>as radiantly as ever."
,msg4-2,But I turned my eyes <br>away and wished...
,msg4-3,
,msg4-4,...for this madness to vanish <br>from my eyes once and for all.
,msg5-1,"Then all of a sudden...<br>color began to vanish <br>from the world,"
,msg5-2,distorting everything <br>I could see.
,msg5-3,"...No,"
,msg5-4,it is not the world <br>that is deforming...
,msg5-5,Is it me?
,msg5-6,I cannot see anything...<br>neither color nor light... <br>Everything...
,msg5-7,has faded away...
