,msg1,I completely forgot that <br>some tribes revere animals <br>as their guardian deities...!
,msg2,"So now, I’m a bad guy trying to <br>take their precious guardian! <br>Worst case scenario, <br>they might even <br>sentence me to...!"
,msg3,"That slimy city official!! <br>He <i>knew</i> this would happen, <br>didn’t he?!"
,msg4,"I <i>have</i> to plead my case! <br>If that girl learns the truth, <br><i>surely</i> she’ll take pity on me <br>and undo these restraints—"
,msg5,“Why do you resist? <br>The weak are destined to die. <br>It’s the law of nature.”
,msg6,"“‘Law of nature’...? <br>Do you <i>really</i> think that <br>just because humans are weaker, <br>any injustice against us <br>is deserved?”"
,msg7-1,"I might, for only <br>being able to save myself... "
,msg7-2,"But, the rest of my tribe who <br>fought to protect our land, <br>and my mother, didn’t deserve <br>to be burned alive...!"

,msg10,“Don’t you <i>dare</i> lump me in <br>with those People of the Stone! <br>I’m...!”
,msg11-1,Why’s she suddenly so upset? 
,msg11-2,"...Though, that sounds like <br>more than just anger... "
,msg11-3,"Well, it’s not my problem, <br>either way..."
