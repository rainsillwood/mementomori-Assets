,msg1-1,I decided to set off on a journey—
,msg1-2,a harsh and grueling journey to <br>the farthest corners of the world.
,msg2-1,"But, everyone from my village <br>just laughed at me, saying, <br>“There’s no way lazy lil’ <br>Eureka can do that!”"
,msg2-2,"They even said, <br>“I bet she’ll come back <br>as soon as she gets hungry”..."
,msg3-1,Uuu... I am a <i>tad</i> bit lazy... 
,msg3-2,"But, I’m also an adventurer!"
,msg4,I won’t go home until <br>my map is complete!
,msg5-1,"Besides, I have my own unique <br>Eureka pace of doing things!"
,msg5-2,"As the wind blows, <br>and my spirit flows, <br>it’s okay if my progress is slow! <br>I’ll just get tired if I try <br>to rush anyway, right~?"
,msg6,And so begins Eureka’s <br>big journey across the world~ <br>Yaaaay~!
,msg7,"But...I’m a bit tired now... <br>So, I’ll start my journey <br>with a break~"
