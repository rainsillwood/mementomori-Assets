,msg1-1,Sometime after I was dispatched <br>to a unit as a squire...
,msg1-2,a new recruit was put <br>under my care.
,msg2-1,"She was a scrawny girl,"
,msg2-2,definitely not someone <br>fit enough to be a knight...
,msg3-1,But surely she came here <br>because she wanted to become <br>a knight of justice—just like me.
,msg3-2,
,msg4,So I had to support and <br>guide her in every way I could...
,msg5-1,"It didn’t look like she could make <br>it through the intense training,"
,msg5-2,so I kept supporting.
,msg5-3,"I reprimanded her, <br>cheered for her..."
,msg6,I truly believed it would <br>all help her grow...
,msg7-1,"Lately, it feels like people are <br>watching, even laughing at me..."
,msg7-2,Am I imagining things?
