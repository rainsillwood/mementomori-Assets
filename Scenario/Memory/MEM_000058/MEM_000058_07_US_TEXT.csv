,msg1-1,I augmented that evil sword <br>with my magic power over <br>a long period of time. 
,msg1-2,I’m sure that same <br>magic power is what’s <br>raging out of control.
,msg2-1,The only way to stop it <br>is to destroy it. 
,msg2-2,"But, challenging that evil sword <br>needs even more magic power <br>than what dwells in it."
,msg3-1,That’s far beyond what <br>I can conjure up...
,msg3-2,but I’ve <i>got</i> to do it. 
,msg3-3,That’s my responsibility <br>as the sword’s creator.
,msg4,"If doing so burns away <br>all the life I have left, <br>so be it."
,msg5-1,"Then, as my hand trembled, "
,msg5-2,Richesse firmly placed hers <br>on top of it.
,msg6,"“If that’s what needs to be done, <br>my power is yours to use, partner.”"
,msg7-1,"Richesse, why...? "
,msg7-2,"As I stood there dumbfounded, "
,msg7-3,she spoke to me with the same <br>bright smile she had on <br>the day we first met.
,msg8,"“We’re partners. <br>We share sins, pain—<br><i>everything</i>. <br>So, don’t you even think of <br>carrying this burden alone.”"
,msg9-1,"In actuality, I knew <br>I shouldn’t involve Richesse. "
,msg9-2,This sin is mine to bear. 
,msg9-3,"But, I didn’t have it in me <br>to brush her hand away."
,msg10-1,"Yes, that’s right. "
,msg10-2,"I create, <br>and Richesse delivers. "
,msg10-3,That’s who we are.
,msg11-1,"From this point on, <br>I’ll keep creating <br>weapons that <br>protect lives..."
,msg11-2,...using these hands <br>that Richesse—
,msg11-3,that my partner <br>believes in.
