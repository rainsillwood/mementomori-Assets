,msg1-1,A world buried beneath<br>a storm of sand.<br>That was the sight I awoke to—
,msg1-2,"the land parched to dust,<br>its cities consumed<br>by the amassing dunes..."
,msg1-3,I had no way of knowing if<br>anyone else had even survived...
,msg2-1,"Not long after, I was saved<br>by a man wielding a staff<br>and his companions."
,msg2-2,They filled me in<br>on everything<br>that had transpired.
,msg3,“We should not have met...<br>If she had not met me...<br>Ayse would be...!”
,msg4-1,"Among the raging<br>tempest winds,<br>I could hear<br>Liberia’s voice."
,msg4-2,They were howls of<br>denial and longing—<br>the strangled cries<br>of my dearest friend...
,msg5,"We shouldn’t have met, huh...?<br>I suppose that’s true..."
,msg6-1,"But, if I hadn’t met you..."
,msg6-2,"I would have been<br>nothing more than<br>a boring researcher,<br>who rejects everyone and<br>everything different from me."
,msg7-1,I never thought about<br>how your people felt...
,msg7-2,No...that still hasn’t changed.<br>I didn’t understand you at all.<br>Like how you’d feel<br>being left behind...
,msg8,"So, I want you to teach me<br>even more about you, Liberia.<br>I’ll teach you more<br>about myself, too."
,msg9-1,The two of us meeting<br>wasn’t a mistake.
,msg9-2,"What heals the scars<br>on our hearts, filling the void<br>that loneliness leaves,"
,msg9-3,is the warmth from knowing<br>someone is willing to bridge<br>the gap to understand us.
,msg10,"If you’re in pain right now,<br>I’ll bridge the gap between us<br>to understand the pain<br>in your heart."
,msg11-1,"You changed me,<br>and made me your friend..."
,msg11-2,so that’s something<br>only I can do.
,msg11-3,Right...Liberia...?
