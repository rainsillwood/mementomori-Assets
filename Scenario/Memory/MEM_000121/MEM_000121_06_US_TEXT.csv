,msg1,Grita told me everything.
,msg2-1,About how she<br>really was an angel.<br>That she’d fought<br>and lost to a demon.
,msg2-2,And that she’d lost her memories<br>from the impact of crashing<br>to the ground.
,msg3,She even told me that<br>I’d accidentally enacted a miracle.
,msg4-1,“Us angels have the power to<br>grant the wishes of humans.
,msg4-2,"When you wished to save me,<br>the power of the miracle lying<br>dormant inside me reacted,"
,msg4-3,and it enacted a miracle that<br>drove off the cursed creature.”
,msg5-1,“Miracles require giving up<br>something as big as<br>the wish in exchange—
,msg5-2,something precious to<br>the one enacting it.
,msg5-3,"For you, Lumica...it’ll likely be<br>one day’s worth of memories with<br>the person you hold most dear.”"
,msg6-1,"“I-If it was to save you, Grita,<br>forgetting one day is nothing!"
,msg6-2,We can just make even <i>more</i><br>fun memories in the future!”
,msg7,"“Yeah. That’s...<br>what I wanted for us, too...”"
,msg8-1,Grita averted her eyes.<br>That’s when I noticed...
,msg8-2,that Grita was slowly<br>fading away.
,msg9,"“This was the only way to<br>save you from certain death,<br>Lumica.”"
,msg10-1,“We exist to grant wishes.
,msg10-2,It is forbidden for us<br>to grant our own.
,msg10-3,So...”
,msg11-1,"“...No...<br>That’s not what I want...!<br>God, please!"
,msg11-2,Take back Grita’s wish!
,msg11-３,Only save Grita...!”
,msg12-1,"“I can’t let that happen.<br>Because, a world without you,"
,msg12-2,is a world I can’t love.”
,msg13,"As Grita said so,<br>she flashed the prettiest smile<br>I’d ever seen."
