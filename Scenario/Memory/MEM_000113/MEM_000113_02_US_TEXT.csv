,msg1-1,"The blue-eyed girl, Aura,"
,msg1-2,"was not only a witch,<br>but an orphan of war just like me.<br>Until now, she had been<br>helping people she came across<br>in her travels."
,msg2-1,"When I asked <i>how</i><br>she was helping them,"
,msg2-2,Aura handed me a bracelet<br>inset with a red gemstone.
,msg3,"“Rustica, what is it<br>that you wish for?”"
,msg4-1,“I want...a sword...”
,msg4-2,"As the words left my lips,<br>the bracelet emitted<br>the same golden light as before,<br>transforming into a rapier."
,msg5,"By sacrificing a piece of jewelry<br>worn on her body<br>for an extended period of time,<br>she could grant any wish.<br><i>That</i> was Aura’s power."
,msg6-1,It was also why Aura<br>was covered head to toe in<br>jangling jewelry of all sorts.
,msg6-2,"I called her a bagworm,<br>only to get a right hook<br>to the face in response."
,msg7,"“My power alone isn’t enough<br>to save everyone.<br>But, that doesn’t mean<br>I shouldn’t still try my best<br>to help people, at least.”"
,msg8,“If the ones I help<br>reach out their hands<br>to others too some day...”
,msg9,Does this self-sacrificing softie<br>not have a hint of skepticism<br>in that brain of hers?
,msg10-1,"Despite her good intentions,<br>all she truly seemed to attract<br>were jewel-hungry thieves."
,msg10-2,"Good grief...<br>She’s so naïve, there’s no <i>way</i><br>I can leave her alone..."
,msg11,Those who learn of Aura’s power<br>all get overtaken with greed<br>sooner or later.<br>That’s what I’d decided...
