,msg1,“Th-This is all just <br>one <i>big</i> misunderstanding! <br>I didn’t know <i>that</i> was <br>what they wanted—really!”
,msg2,I had barely entered the tent <br>before the captive messenger girl <br>started prattling off <br>that frantic apology.
,msg3-1,"Apparently, the girl was of <br>the People of the Plains, <br>but from a tribe that was taken over <br>by the People of the Stone."
,msg3-2,"“I’m too weak, so I had no choice <br>but to obey their will!”—<br>or so she said."
,msg4-1,The messenger was desperately <br>searching for any way to <br>make it out of her predicament alive.
,msg4-2,The girl’s attempts to beg for her life <br>were truly a pathetic display to behold.
,msg5,“Why do you resist? <br>The weak are destined to die. <br>It’s the law of nature.”
,msg6,"“‘Law of nature’...? <br>Do you <i>really</i> think that <br>just because humans are weaker, <br>any injustice against us is deserved?”"

,msg8,"“Guess that ‘guardian deity’ <br>shtick is just a name to you. <br>In the end, you’re no different <br>from those people in the city.”"
,msg9,“Don’t you <i>dare</i> lump me in <br>with those People of the Stone! <br>I’m...!”
,msg10,"What do they know...?! <br>This girl before me, <br>the People of the Stone, <br>the ones who took me in...!"
,msg11,Even though <i>I’ve</i> been <br>the one fending off <br>the People of the Stone’s <br>attacks this whole time...!
,msg12-1,Why does no one <br>acknowledge me as a wolf...?!
,msg12-2,Just what...am I missing...?!
