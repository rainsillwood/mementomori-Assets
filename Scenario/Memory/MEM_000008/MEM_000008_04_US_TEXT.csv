,msg1-1,Sometime later...
,msg1-2,a Letter of Summons came <br>from the Pope for Fortina.
,msg1-3,"My blood froze, <br>fearing that she had been <br>targeted by the <ct=3000>Witch Hunt</ct>,"
,msg1-4,but it seemed like she was <br>being summoned to have <br>her humanity restored.
,msg2-1,But in that letter...
,msg2-2,it was also written that <br><i>I</i> was to accompany her. <br>Why would it...?
,msg3,"Maybe I’m just overthinking it, <br>but something doesn’t <br>feel right here..."
,msg4-1,We proceeded with caution <br>as we presented ourselves <br>to the Pope...
,msg4-2,It was then that she started <br>cursing at Fortina for <br>being a witch.
,msg5-1,I became livid and <br>challenged her accusations.
,msg5-2,“Fortina...a <ct=3000>witch of calamity</ct>?! <br>That’s just...ridiculous...!”
,msg6,But then the Pope <br>turned her <ct=3000>lance</ct> on me...<br>contorting the world <br>before my very eyes.
