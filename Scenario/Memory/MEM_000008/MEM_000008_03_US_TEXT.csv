,msg1-1,Many years since then...
,msg1-2,the village was once again <br>devastated by a plague—
,msg1-3,the same one that infected <br>me as a child.
,msg2-1,"With each passing day, <br>more and more people die..."
,msg2-2,"But, what’s more concerning is <br>how much of an emotional strain <br>it all has been for Fortina."
,msg3-1,She’s apparently been praying <br>at the Church ever since <br>the plague started spreading...
,msg3-2,
,msg3-3,I just hope she’s eating <br>properly this time.
,msg4-1,"Feeling uneasy, <br>I go to the Church to check on her...<br>but what I found there was Fortina—"
,msg4-2,transformed into a <ct=3000>witch</ct>.
,msg5-1,"She looked pale with fear, <br>so I embraced her as <br>strongly as I could."
,msg5-2,"It’s going to be okay, Fortina..."
,msg5-3,I’m sorry for not noticing <br>what happened to you.
,msg5-4,It must’ve been so terrifying...
,msg6-1,"If this is one of “God’s trials” <br>that you usually talk about,"
,msg6-2,then I’ll face it alongside you.
,msg6-3,"I won’t let you suffer alone... <br>I vowed to always <br>protect you, after all."
,msg7,"Everything <i>will</i> be okay. <br>If the two us are together, <br>I’m <i>sure</i> we can get <br>through this."
