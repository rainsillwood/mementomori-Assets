,msg1,"“Professor, what is the ‘sky?’”"
,msg2,<ct=3000>Little A</ct> asked me that question <br>after I let her read a book.
,msg3-1,She has no clue what the sky is <br>because she’s never set foot <br>outside the laboratory.
,msg3-2,"I showed her some photographs, <br>but that just added to <br>her bewilderment."
,msg4-1,No amount of words or <br>photographs can convey how <br>blue and beautiful the sky is.
,msg4-2,
,msg4-3,"After staring at the collections <br>of blue ink for a while,"
,msg4-4,"she looked up at the laboratory <br>ceiling and muttered in curiousity,"
,msg4-5,“The sky here is so white...”
,msg5,“I sure hope you can see <br>the real sky one day.”
,msg6,"“That would be nice,” she replied, <br>her emotionless eyes trembling <br>ever so slightly."
,msg7,Is there any way to <br>show Little A the sky?
,msg8-1,"If I learned of a witch <br>who could control light, <br>I went to ask them if they’d <br>make a sky for Little A."
,msg8-2,"If I got word of a book with <br>beautiful photographs of the sky, <br>I procured it at once."
,msg9-1,"My research falls behind,"
,msg9-2,and I spend more time exclusively <br>on these “experiments.”
,msg10-1,"By the time I realized it,"
,msg10-2,she was the only thing <br>I could think about.
