,msg1,This girl is <br>“the child of miracles.”
,msg2,"It’s rare, but I <i>have</i><br>come across those who hold <br>either the power of an angel, <br>or that of a demon. <br>But, this is the first time <br>I’ve ever laid eyes on <br>a girl who possesses <br>the power of both."
,msg3-1,"Not only does she wield a soul <br>strong enough to withstand two <br>completely opposing powers, <br>those powers dwell <br>in harmony within her."
,msg3-2,This girl doesn’t even <br>realize how much of <br>a miracle she truly is.
,msg4,...No... This can’t possibly <br>all be a coincidence.
,msg5-1,She is a miracle <br>that shouldn’t exist. <br>Someone <i>made</i> her this way.
,msg5-2,"To be able to save the world, <br>or destroy it..."
,msg6,What lies in store for this girl <br>is a destiny full of struggle. <br>It’s a fate no ordinary girl <br>could bear.
,msg7-1,"But, if she can face her destiny <br>without giving up, <br>and continue to push forward..."
,msg7-2,"she’ll likely be more beautiful, <br>and shine brighter, than anyone."
,msg8,I want to see her <br>reach that destiny...!
,msg9-1,"And, I have the ability <br>to give that girl..."
,msg9-2,"to give Illya, that power...!"
