,msg1-1,I quickly head to the city square <br>and see traveling acrobats<br>putting on a show. 
,msg1-2,Watching them were children <br>with bright smiles on their faces.
,msg2,"Then, as I was about to ask <br>the acrobats if I could join them, <br>something happened."
,msg3,"“Enough with the noise. <br>This is a ritual ceremony, <br>damn sinners.”"
,msg4-1,"When that elderly man came <br>out of the crowd and said that, "
,msg4-2,"the music came to <br>a complete stop, "
,msg4-3,and the smiles disappeared <br>from the children’s faces.
,msg5,"Wait, didn’t Vera say <br>something about this?"
,msg6-1,"I think she said, <br>while this event’s more like <br>a music festival nowadays, "
,msg6-2,"one of the elderly thinks otherwise, <br>and causes an uproar every year."
,msg7-1,"And, the ritual ceremony should <br>be held quietly to mourn the dead, "
,msg7-2,"so making noise will incur <br>the wrath of the dead, <br>or something..."
,msg8,“It’s absolutely ridiculous <br>how vulgar acrobatics are. <br>Get that filth out of my city!”
,msg9-1,"After saying that, <br>the elderly man swung <br>his cane around, "
