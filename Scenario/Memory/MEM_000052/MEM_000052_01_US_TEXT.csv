,msg3,"A hot spring that does <br><i>wonders</i> for the lower back, <br>and a legend of an ebony sword."
,msg4,"Whoever finds that sword <br>becomes its “swordbearer,” <br>and they gotta go search <br>for its true master."
,msg5,"As the story goes, <br>if the master isn’t found, <br>the sword’ll drain the life of <br>the swordbearer until they die."
,msg6,The boys in my village tried <br>their hardest to find the sword... <br>But me? Zero interest.
