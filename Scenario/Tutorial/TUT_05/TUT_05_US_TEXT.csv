,msg1,We somehow stopped the Witch of Qlipha...<br>but I didn’t expect her to be such a young girl...
,msg2,"She may have been a normal, gentle girl to begin with.<br>But, it seems like someone used the weakness in her heart <br>to send her raging out of control."
,msg3,No way... Who would do such a thing...?
,msg4,"...I can’t say for certain.<br>Nevertheless, the power of the Staff seem to have restored her.<br>It shouldn’t be long before she wakes up."
,msg5,Are there Witches of Qlipha in other countries as well―<br>forced to lose control of their powers like Natasha was?
,msg6,"Indeed. There are 10 Witches of Qlipha in the world.<br>I dare say that someone is forcing them all to rage out of control,<br>thereby evoking the 10 Curses that are spreading throughout the world."
,msg7,...! My body...!!
,msg8,"Hey, what’s wrong?!"
,msg9,(Everything hurts...<br>Maybe the Curse wasn’t dispelled...but instead...)
,msg10,...I’m fine. It’s nothing.<br>I’m just a little tired.
,msg11,"More importantly, if we free the Witches of Qlipha from<br>whoever’s controlling them, the world will be saved, right?<br>Alright—we have to get going. There’s no time to waste."
