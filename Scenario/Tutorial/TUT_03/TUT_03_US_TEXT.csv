,msg1,I feel an immense power up ahead.<br>It must be the one who unleashed this Curse—the “Witch of Qlipha.”
,msg2,But take a good look at that town.<br>We can’t even get near it because of the Curse.
,msg3,"At this rate, the whole country will be destroyed.<br>Someone’s got to stop her before that happens."
,msg4,So <i>that</i> is the Curse of the “Witch of Qlipha...”<br>I never imagined it to be this horrifying...
,msg5,"...Wait. With how strong we are now,<br>we may be able to save that town."
,msg6,...Huh?!
,msg7,"The Staff has the power to restore the cursed land. <br>If it can do that, then it can possibly do the same <br>to any town ravaged by the Curse."
,msg8,"Of course, it’s easier said than done.<br>But if it’s you, then perhaps..."
,msg9,Please! Use your power and save them all!
